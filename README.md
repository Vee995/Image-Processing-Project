South African Bank Notes Recognition System
 
Objective: Identify the properties (features) of the depicted bank note in a reference collection of notes. The bank note recognition
system should compute a similarity measure between notes that are invariant tosides, scale and rotations, because the bank note has two faces, and the
orientation of the note can either be upright or up-side-down. 

Implementation of a robust image processing system is completed which classifies each input bank note image appropriately.
